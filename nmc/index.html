					<h2>New Media Certificate Summary</h2>
					<p>
                        Earning the New Media Certificate has been a transformative experience, bridging my technical foundation in computer science with creative and user-focused design principles. When I first began the program, I saw technology purely as a tool for building solutions. Through this journey, I have come to understand the power of storytelling, design, and user experience in creating technology that resonates with people on a deeper level.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        The certificate taught me more than just technical skills—it helped me develop a mindset of empathy and adaptability. I’ve gained the ability to approach challenges creatively, blending technical expertise with a user-first perspective. This program has introduced me to emerging technologies and frameworks, such as SwiftUI and Vue.js, while helping me refine my design thinking and collaborative skills.
                    </p> 
                    <p>  
                        Throughout the program, I’ve been fortunate to network with entrepreneurs, developers, and leaders from some of the world’s most influential companies, broadening my understanding of what’s possible in the new media industry. Each project, from crafting dynamic web applications to collaborating with a client on an iPad app, pushed me to grow as a designer, developer, and problem-solver.
                    </p> 
                    <p>   
                        The New Media Certificate has allowed me to see the bigger picture of how technology, creativity, and strategy come together to solve real-world problems. It has equipped me with the confidence to innovate, adapt, and thrive in any professional environment I pursue.

					<h2>NMIX 4020 - Advanced Web Development</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
					<div class="project">
						<p>This is the first course that I took through the New Media department at UGA. This was my first experience with front-end development, and throughout my time in NMIX 4020, I was able to pick up skills in not only HTML/CSS to create a basic webpage, but also how I can use JavaScript and existing JS frameworks such as Vue.js to help create a more dynamic and interactive front-end website!</p>
						<p>This was also my first time learning Vue.js, which enabled me to set up my personal website and explore advanced features like dynamic data binding and modular design. The course was an incredible stepping stone in understanding how web technologies come together to create seamless user experiences.</p>

					<h2>NMIX 4210 - New Media Industries</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
					<div class="project">
						<p>This course gave me an incredible opportunity to explore the professional landscape of new media by interacting with inspiring entrepreneurs, developers, and representatives from some of the world's biggest companies. Through weekly seminars, I gained invaluable insights into best practices and career experiences in the industry while expanding my professional network.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center">
					<h2>NMIX 4410 - New Media Capstone</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
					<div class="project">
						<p>The New Media Capstone was the culmination of my journey through the New Media Certificate program. In this course, I collaborated with a team to develop a functioning iPad app tailored to a client's specific needs. I learned how to work with Swift and SwiftUI to design and implement features that met the client's requirements while maintaining a strong focus on user experience. This hands-on project tied together all the skills I gained throughout the program and showcased my ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.</p>

						<h3>CSCI 4050 - Software Engineering</h3>
						<p>My first large-scale project-based class, very similar to Capstone, but without the challenges of working with a client.</p>

						<h3>CSCI 4060 - Mobile Software Development</h3>
						<p>In this class, I learned about creating Android-friendly mobile apps using Android Studio, and learned how to incorporate Firebase to create a secure user registration page.</p>
